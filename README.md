# Yuri's Revenge - Community Edition

![YR_CE_Logo_v2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72227841/173371253-bbb8a9db-5a1d-487f-a88b-e8e6e112f9b7.png)

A mod born out of love for one of the best RTS's of our time. Composed primarily of community based feedback from the Scorched Earth Discord server. As well as tons of communal assets and contributions, some of which are exclusive. The end goal is to create something I / we feel could have been a legitimate upgrade to Yuri's Revenge without altering the gameplay beyond recognition. And hopefully this mod achieves that.
